package begin 'A' --> ping command (followed by crc)
package begin 'Z' --> pong command (followed by crc)
package begin 'M' --> begin of a message (which may include or not some data)

followed by: XY* where X is a command, and Y* is some data

Y* data may follow this scheme: Y','Y2','... i.e: h,67,2045

followed by 'C' and the CRC8 of the begin and body of the message

Full example: "Mf45039,hello,2C27" // 177 // 133

That message sends the command 'f' with the data "45039", "hello", "2" and its CRC8 is 27 (not calculated)

The crc8 code was calculated using "Mf45,hello,2" as input
