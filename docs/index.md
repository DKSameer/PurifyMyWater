# Welcome to PurifyMyWater
Here you can read about the hardware & software used to bring to the world the first DIY water purifying system which can be assembled without spending lots of resources in expensive components.

## About us
This project is being developed by [**@vacmg**](https://github.com/vacmg) with the support of the [**ALUMNOS SOLIDARIOS**](https://www.joyfe.es/gente-joyfe/alumnos-solidarios/) initiative of JOYFE's school in Madrid.

Currently, we are developing and testing a prototype which will be deployed in the Kanhankro school and will supply arround **1500L** of clean water per day to the school and the surrounding area.
