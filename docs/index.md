# Welcome to PurifyMyWater
Here you can read about the hardware & software used to bring to the world the first DIY water purifying system which can be assembled without spending lots of resources in expensive components.

## About us
This project is being developed by [**@vacmg**](https://github.com/vacmg) with the support of the [**ALUMNOS SOLIDARIOS**](https://www.joyfe.es/gente-joyfe/alumnos-solidarios/) initiative of JOYFE's school in Madrid.

Currently, we are developing and testing a prototype which will be deployed in the Kanhankro school and will supply arround **1500L** of clean water per day to the school and the surrounding area.

## Hardware
The main idea of this project is to use cheap items to create a robust machine that is almost self-sufficient and easily scalable. To achieve that, we have split the system into the control unit, and some peripherals. With little or no change to the control unit and the code, our solution can be expanded to purify more water if required.
